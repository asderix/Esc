A powerful name matching library that is easy to use. Built on the shoulders of giants.
With a lot of passion and currently little time.

The library is still in its infancy and therefore cannot be used directly yet.

The solution will support various name-matching problems. Examples are Spelling mistakes, different spellings,
translation and transcription differences, hyphenation and merging, order of name elements, missing name
elements, known abbreviations, etc. These problems can all be solved by the solution.

In addition, the comparison of the secondary criteria country (country of birth, nationalities, countries of
domicile, etc.) and dates of birth/dates of founding is also supported.

The solution is optimized both for the comparison of natural persons and for the comparison of companies and
organizations.

Application examples will follow as soon as the solution can be used.
